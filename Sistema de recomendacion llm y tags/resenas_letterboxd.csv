no-country-for-old-men,hamburgerpimp,No Country for Old Men,5.0,"There’s a scene early on in No Country for Old Men, where Anton Chigurh finds himself captured by the authorities and has to fight his way out of a police station. Taking advantage of a distracted deputy, Chigurh sneaks behind him and strangles the unsuspecting lawman, using his own handcuffs to subdue him, before finally cutting his jugular, spilling his life’s blood onto the cheap vinyl floor. As the poor soul flops around, trying to break free of his assassin,…"
north-by-northwest,hamburgerpimp,North by Northwest,5.0,"Look. I’m just as happy as the rest of you. Hitchcock and writer Ernest Lehman gave the audience exactly what they wanted, narratively speaking — Cary Grant’s Roger Thornhill is victorious in the end, able to survive one attempt on his life after another. Thornhill even gets to visit the tunnel of love with the sexy Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint), who’s been batting her eyelashes at our hero since she entered the picture. But let’s be real for a moment. After having the crop duster dump a full load of chemicals all over him, dude has 6 months to a year to live, tops."
sinners-2025,hamburgerpimp,Sinners,5.0,"Sinners is filed with beautiful and detailed costume design by Ruth E. Carter. That said, clearly her best decision was to have a vampire wear a Cosby sweater."
sinners-2025,hamburgerpimp,Sinners,5.0,"There’s a rare reaction I can have when a movie firmly grabs hold of me. To clarify — I don’t just mean when a film fully captures my attention — that happens frequently. What I’m referring to happens on a molecular level, when the film is able to make me lean in, tune out everything going on around me, and fully transport me into the world it’s so vividly created. I call it “The Purple Rose of Cairo Effect” and…"

Switchblades may look cool, but they’re incredibly insufficient when you get in a tussle with a cybernetic organism2. It’s always best to opt for an unlisted phone number3.

peeping-tom,hamburgerpimp,Peeping Tom,5.0,"65 years on and Peeping Tom is still the preeminent horror film about horror movies and the audience’s relationship with the genre. Why are we so fascinated by movies where people are viciously attacked and summarily dispatched via increasing horrific and violent methods?The one aspect of Peeping Tom that fascinates me most is how director Micheal Powell and writer Leo Marks accurately predicted the rise of the slasher film, which was still more than a decade from piercing the…"
his-girl-friday,hamburgerpimp,His Girl Friday,5.0,"Whenever I meet a film fan with an allergy to classic and/or B&W cinema, I show them His Girl Friday, and that typically makes them more receptive to watching TCM joints.If it doesn’t, I just lock them away in my antique, roll-top desk until they tell me what I want to hear."

how-to-train-your-dragon-2025,jeaba,How to Train Your Dragon,,probably not going to rate this one because i have a lot of conflicting thoughts about it but overall i really enjoyed it! i’m definitely able to recognize that a live action how to train your dragon is not necessary and doesn’t add much value to the original movie… but i’m also really nerdy about dragons and easily blinded by nostalgia so this movie made me feel giddy as hell

moonrise-kingdom,annabean,Moonrise Kingdom,9.0,"I wanted to watch a Wes Anderson movie to get in the mood forAsteroid City.I picked this one because it seems like it might be the closest in form: the retro setting, a (super)natural intervention, satire of societal authorities, and childhood wonder vs. sad adulthood.

spider-man-across-the-spider-verse,annabean,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,5.0,"Spider-Punk is the MVP -- literally the most consequential ally for both Miles and Gwen. And it's really not a coincidence that he's the breakout character here. This whole series, but particularly this chapter, shows a truly anti-establishment sensibility: breaking animation rules, interrogating comic book tropes, challenging old generational ideologies (including the popular 'well, I suffered; therefore, so must you'), and rejecting societal constraints of what people are allowed to be.Don't ever let society (even Spider Society) tell you how to live your own life."

It is immersive and thorough, benefitting fully from the hindsight of history as it painstakingly chronicles one of the most tragic follies in American foreign policy.From the ignored foreshadowing of France's attempted occupation in the century prior, to the dawning realization of…"

sinners-2025,flanaganfilm,Sinners,,"WOW - absolutely loved this. Terrific performances, some truly jaw-dropping music sequences (that first one at the juke joint is an all-timer), and the vampires are just a metaphorical wrapper for a story about racial and cultural identity, appropriation, and legacy. I thought the film was very, very good as the credits started to roll, but the mid-credit sequence elevated it to absolute greatness for me, and fully completed the emotional arc of the whole movie.

Showing the cinema behind the scenes shouldn't have been easy, but it clearly didn't have become a problem in the hands of a genius like Truffat.

bound,taylorfilmguy,Bound,8.0,"Love how low concept this is. It starts out as “what ifDrivehad swag” for like 40 minutes and then becomes total straight-faced Hitchcock for the last hour, where the simplicity becomes a visual playground for Pope and the Wachowskis. The erotic element is a bit front loaded (and quite loaded that front is, I’ll add), but when the ostensible main character drops out of the movie for so long, the sense of voyeurism that’s been built up helps justify her presence in the other room. After watchingDr. MabuseI can’t look at Joey Pants the same way, I only see Rudolf Klein-Rogge."

On the neo-screwball meter, this isn’t as physically chaotic asWhat’s Up, Doc?, but Nichols is simply keeping everything on a tight leash so that May’s writing can speak for itself (this thing takesThe Heartbreak Kid’s “no deceit in the cauliflower” shtick and stretches it out for like 45 minutes).

throne-of-blood,filmcal,Throne of Blood,8.0,quite literally cannot go wrong with kurosawa and shakespeare. my only complaint is that i would’ve liked the no man born of a woman can harm macbeth prophecy to be included just because the c-section reveal is one of the best reveals in all of literature (glad they had the moving forest part though)

red-rooms,filmcal,Red Rooms,6.0,disturbing and unnerving to watch especially from the point of view of our off putting main character who we never really know the intentions behind her actions throughout. should be a mandatory watch for every weirdo who obsesses over true crime and makes youtube videos with insensitive thumbnails and titles. after hearing so much about this though i was expecting something different that was actually challenging to watch but i think the lack of gore and violence shown was a great choice.
our-little-sister,filmcal,Our Little Sister,9.0,i don’t know how kore-eda does it but he really does know how to create such a unique human and familial story every time. grown up siblings are always an interesting dynamic and even more so if they are all under the same roof and suddenly take in their half-sister after their father dies. just perfect as always i’m going to be really sad when i eventually run out of his work and i have to wait for whatever he creates next

police-story,filmcal,Police Story,9.0,maybe one of the coolest movies ever made and you think you’ve watched the craziest stunt possible and then like 20 minutes later an even crazier stunt happens. loved them showing the pole stunt 3 times in a row just because of how impressive it was.the sequence towards the start with the cars driving through the village on the hill might be one of the best action set pieces ever
the-hidden-fortress,filmcal,The Hidden Fortress,6.0,found this to be a bit tedious and annoying if i’m honest even though i really love the other kurosawa movies i've watched. very funny watching this and seeing the moments that so obviously inspired george lucas though

It’s effortless and maybe that’s after watching the last two which felt so labored. It’s so beautifully directed that it puts current action films to shame. It’s lean while still being full of action, comedy, heart and story. Having Tom Stoppard do the Father/Son dialogue was a genius choice and the film manages to be a send off that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

ratatouille,frostyfoxx,Ratatouille,5.0,"""Ratatouille"" is one of those movies where you really don't need a sequel — the original is just flawless and totally enough. It's a fun, charming comedy that's entertaining for kids and adults alike. What's cool is how it tackles moments that other movies usually do the same way, but here they're either rearranged or shown differently, which makes the movie feel fresh and unique. Plus, this lovely Pixar dish brings a rare kind of calmness that adds variety to the usual. It's the perfect movie to cozy up with on a rainy day and warm your heart and soul."
